### Howdy, folks ðŸ¤ ðŸ’»

ðŸ˜¹ ðŸ˜» I am operating as a front-end developer on a team of very talented people. ðŸ˜º ðŸ˜¸ 

 ðŸ‘¾ Iâ€™m currently learning everything that I can get my nads on!...but mostyly JavaScript. ðŸ¤– 


My interest for the Full Stack Engineer position actually started many years ago when I was much younger. I had witnessed a friend of mine do some magic with C++ and it immediately resonated with me. 

Fast forward to the â€˜MySpace daysâ€™ where I was an HTML/CSS guru helping friends create amazing designs they can show off. Of course that lead to many more doors through  the endless world of coding.Â To Many more years of dabbling into software and hardware. Learning new technologies. How they work, how to break, fix  and make them more efficient. 

I have been fortunate enough to be a part of a be a part of 2 wonderful teams of developers operating as a Front-end & Back-end Developer.  I am absolutely addicted to the process of creating & collaborating with a team of like minded folks. From planning & drawing out tentative ideas to testing them out. Having deadlines & being held accountable. learning new technologies & micro-services to make those ideas come to life.
