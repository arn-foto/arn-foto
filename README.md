### Howdy, folks ğŸ¤ ğŸ’» ###

ğŸ˜¹ ğŸ˜» I am currently operating as a front-end developer on a team of very talented people. ğŸ˜º ğŸ˜¸ 

 ğŸ‘¾ Learning everything that I can get my hands on!...but mostly JavaScript. ğŸ¤– 


My interest in coding started many years ago when I was much younger. I had witnessed a friend of mine do some magic with C++ and it immediately resonated with me. I was hooked. 

Fast forward to the "MySpace days"(I just aged myself) where I was an HTML/CSS guru helping friends create amazing designs they can show off. Of course that lead to many more doors through the endless world of coding. Learning new technologies. How they work, how to break, fix, and break again. ğŸ™ƒ 

I am absolutely addicted to the process of creating & collaborating with a team of like minded folks. From planning & drawing out tentative ideas to testing them out. Having deadlines & being held accountable. learning new technologies & micro-services to make those ideas come to life.  ğŸ¤“
