### Howdy, folks ğŸ¤ ğŸ’» ###

ğŸ˜¹ ğŸ˜» I am currently interning as a front-end developer on a team of very talented people. ğŸ˜º ğŸ˜¸ 

 ğŸ‘¾ Learning everything that I can get my hands on!...but mostly JavaScript. ğŸ¤– 

My interest in becoming a programmer started when I was much younger. I witnessed a friend of mine do some magic with C++ and an I.P. address and I was hooked.

I have always modeled my life around technology while staying current with its growth. With that being said there is no way to fully measure my passion for it. It's off the chart though. Of course that lead to many more doors through the endless world of coding. Learning new technologies. How they work, how to break, fix, and break again. ğŸ™ƒ 

I am absolutely addicted to the process of creating & collaborating in a team of like minded folks. From planning & drawing out tentative ideas to testing them out. Having deadlines & being held accountable. learning new technologies & micro-services to make those ideas come to life.  ğŸ¤“
